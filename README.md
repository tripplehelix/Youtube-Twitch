# Youtube-Twitch
A website that displays Youtube live next to Twitch chat.

Sorry it's completely uncommented. I might get to that later. I created this project mainly to learn how github works.

Feel free to use this yourself! Should be a simple case of replacing all mentions of 'exbc' with your own stream name, the youtube live URL and footer information.
